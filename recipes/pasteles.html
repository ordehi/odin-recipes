      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        If you are familiar with Caribbean food, then you should know almost
        everything is made or is accompanied by plantains (unripe bananas). This
        looks like the Mexican tamale, and is made almost the same way, but with
        different ingredients. And of course instead of a corn outside layer it
        is made with plantains. This is a holiday staple. You can find the
        plantain leaves in any Hispanic market, in the frozen foods section. If
        you can't find it replace with parchment paper.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut the banana leaves into 8x8-inch squares wash, pat dry and reserve.
        </li>
        <h3>If Using Pork or Chicken</h3>
        <li>
          Place a small chicken (about a 2lbs) or pork loin in a crock pot and
          liberally sprinkle with adobo seasoning until covered. Set on low for
          6-8 hours When done, allow it to cool and shred it with your fingers.
          Now you can use it for the pasteles.
        </li>
        <h3>If Using Ground Beef</h3>
        <li>
          In a bowl combine the meat with the onion powder, oregano, basil, 2
          tbsp adobo seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a pan over medium heat, heat up oil and add garlic, onions and
          pepper. Sauté until tender. Add 1/2 lb of meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook until no longer pink and drain. Return to heat and 2 tbsp of
          water and tomato paste. Cook until all liquid has evaporated. Reserve.
        </li>
        <h3>If Using Cooked Pork or Chicken</h3>
        <li>
          Heat up oil over medium heat and add garlic, onions and pepper until
          tender; add 1/2 lb meat. Season with oregano, bay, onion powder, black
          pepper and salt if needed. Stir until combined. Add 2 tbsp water and
          tomato paste, heat through, for about 2 minutes or until liquid has
          evaporated. Reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
          Peel the plantains, niame and malanga. Grate the raw niame, malanga
          and plantain and mix with 1 tsp of adobo seasoning and 1 tspn salt.
          Add the broth either store-bought kind or the broth made if you
          slow-cooked the chicken. It will look like a doughy mass. Don't make
          it too wet.
        </li>
        <h3>For Assembly</h3>
        <li>
          Put 2 tbsp of the plantain mixture on the center of a banana tree
          leaf, on top put 1 tspn of meat, and top that with 2 more tbsp of the
          plantain mixture. Wrap the leaf around it to form a rectangle; about
          5-7" in length and 3-4" in width. Wrap another layer of parchment
          paper over each one. Tie string once around and once the other way to
          resemble a present, and tie a knot in the middle. At this point you
          can freeze them by wrapping a third layer of foil over each one and
          store for up to a month, just remove foil before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          When ready to make, put half a gallon of water in a very large pot and
          boil them for 20 minutes. Remove the banana leaf before eating.
        </li>
        <li>We usually eat them with Tabasco sauce and/or ketchup. Enjoy!</li>
